                Introduction to Counter Strike: Global Offensive
            </h1>
            <p>
                Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) expands upon the team-based action game play that the franchise pioneered when it was launched 12 years ago. CS:GO features new maps, characters, and weapons and delivers updated versions of the classic CS content
                (de_dust, etc.). In addition, CS:GO introduces new game play modes, matchmaking, leader boards, and more.
            </p>

            <h1>Game Modes</h1>
            <h2>Classic: Competitive</h2>
            <p>
                This is the classic game play that made Counter-Strike famous. Queue up and join a 5v5 best-of-30 match using standard competitive Counter-Strike rules on one of the classic maps. You can join a match on your own, or form a team and enter a match
                as a unit.
            </p>

            <h2>Classic: Casual</h2>
            <p>Ready to play some Counter-Strike, but don’t want to commit to a full match? Find a casual match and play at your own pace. In Casual mode, players automatically receive body armour and defuse kits and gain bonus rewards for kills.</p>

            <h2>Demolition</h2>
            <p>
                In demolition mode, players take turns attacking and defending a single bombsite in a series of maps designed for fast-paced game play. Players are automatically granted a starting weapon, and advance through a sequence of firearms when they register
                a kill. If you’re up to the challenge, you can try to register a kill each round and reach the ultimate weapons, powerful sniper rifles!
            </p>

            <h2>Arms Race</h2>
            <p>
                Arms race is a gun-progression mode featuring instant respawning and a ton of close-quarter combat. Players gain new weapons immediately after registering a kill as they work their way through each weapon in the game. Get a kill with the final weapon,
                a golden knife, and win the match.
            </p>


            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>
                In 1999 Counter-Strike was released as a mod for Half-Life. As Counter-Strike progressed from a beta to a full release, it refined the classic game play that has come to define competitive shooters and produced a dedicated community that has followed
                the game for over a decade. Through each of its iterations – 1.6, Source, and Global Offensive – Counter-Strike has been the de facto benchmark of a player’s skill. Teams from around the world are constantly demonstrating their ability and strategies
                in local, regional, and international tournaments. Professional Counter-Strike players have become legendary in the international gaming community. Below, learn about some of these players and how they shaped the history of Counter-Strike.
